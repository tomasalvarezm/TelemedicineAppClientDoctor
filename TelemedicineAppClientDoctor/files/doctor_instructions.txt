DOCTOR’S INSTRUCTIONS:

If it’s the first time you access the application, you will need to register as a new doctor clicking
in the “REGISTER” button. Then, a new screen will appear, where you will have to enter your ID, name
and sex. 

Once you are registered, you will be able to log in your account by typing your ID.

Then, you will have access to your patient’s list with their personal and medical information.
 
By selecting one patient, you could choose between seeing that patient's medical history, which
includes the medication they are taking and the different side effects they might be experiencing, or
the physiological parameters. After choosing, a new screen will appear in which you can sort by date
which file you want to open. This applies for the medical history of the patient as same as for the
recorded EMG bitalino signal (with the time it took to record the signal).

Once you are finished, you can exit the application safely.
